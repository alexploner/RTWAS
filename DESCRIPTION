Description: This package is a re-write of methods forked from the FUSION suite
    of tools for transcriptome-wide association analyses combining genetic and 
    gene expression data <https://github.com/gusevlab/fusion_twas>. Focus is on 
    implementation as a proper R package, rather than the FUSION script style, 
    allowing for easier usage, modification and documentation, while maintaining 
    compatability as much as possibble.
